In this project so far I learned the primary difference between Link and NavLink components from react-router

i) Using Link it just prevents the full page reload (gets displayed in the browser as an anchor tag)

ii) Using NavLink, it also gets displayed as an anchor tag but it is not just used for navigating the pages, it provides features like isActive and isPending which is crucial for showing the currently opened tab/page and we can put some CSS based on that
