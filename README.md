# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Hydration üëç

The process when javascript is loaded into a server rendered HTML, is called hydration. Think of it as a dry sponge.
So the server rendered initial HTML is the dry sponge (basic structure, not interactive). And when water (javascript) is poured over this dry sponge to make it interactive. 

This process is called hydration.

Reconciliation üëç

The process that React follows to determine how to update user interface when a change is occured. It compares the current UI (previous virtual DOM) and the new UI (updated virtual DOM) and makes relevant changes in the real DOM. So for this comparision, React uses the diffing algorith. This entire process is called reconciliation.

Diffing algorith üëç

As discussed above, this is the algorithm that React uses to differentiate the changes in the two virtual DOMs (the current and the new one). The purpose of diffing is to identify which parts of the UI have changed so React can minimize updates and only re-render the parts that have actually changed, instead of re-rendering the entire UI.

NPM üëç

It's called the node package manager. All the libraries/packages are stored in the npm registry. We can use npm i to install any package/libray locally using this command.

NPX üëç

It's called the node package executer. It is a package runner tool that means it can run the packages we use with its command without having to intall that package locally.

A good example is npx create-react-app my-app (this command will only run the create-react-app package to generate a React app without having to install React locally.)
